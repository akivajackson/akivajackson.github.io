      <h2>The 3rd Love Symposium</h2>
      <p>The 3rd Love Symposium will take place from December 16-18, 2022 in Würzburg, Germany. This year's theme is "What is Love?" and participants will have the opportunity to present and share their thoughts, insights, and experiences on this topic through various mediums such as writing, music, dance, art, and more. The symposium will begin with a Shabbat dinner on Friday night and end with the lighting of the first Hanukkah candle on Sunday night. The cost for the weekend is 30 euros, which covers vegan and vegetarian food, drinks, coffee, and tea. If you are interested in attending, please let Dvir know by the end of October (31.10) and provide details on your contribution by the end of November (30.11). Please note that this is a brave space, where vulnerability and honesty will be embraced, but please also be mindful of your own capacities and boundaries.</p>

      <li>What's the easiest way to get there? Probably via flight to Frankfurt, and then a direct train. It’s not too complicated, but best to book in advance! As prices always rise for some reason in the world of capitalism. There are also other creative and cheaper ways - flights to Nurenberg, Memmingen, Berlin - feel free to ask me about those, I have some experience :)</li>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Q: May I bring someone I love with me?</td>
        <td>A: Absolutely. They would also be expected to contribute their own contribution. And if you want to do something together, about your love, that is also very welcome. Whatever kind of love that may be.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Q: Where will I sleep?</td>
        <td>A: Würzburg is a beautiful city, with many beautiful people. Some would love to host you, and I am happy to arrange that. If you’d rather find yourself an arrangement, there are also wonderful hotels and airbnbs around. But, theoretically, this shouldn’t be a part of your expenses, if you wish to join us.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Q: I am so very busy, may I join just for the Symposium itself?</td>
        <td>A: Absolutely yes. It’s important to note the Symposium’s evening is a one way ticket, once you agree to join the space you are expected to stay all the way through everyone’s contributions. Unless, of course, there is an emergency - which is always in your hands to decide what that means. We will always respect your choice.</td>
