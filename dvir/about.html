      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>I was born in Ashdod, went to a gifted kids school, and spent my middle school years in the Zurich International School - where I learnt to speak fluent English and fell in love with German. I started my B.Sc. at 16 years old, when I moved back to Israel, and majored in Mathematics and Physics (with a minor in Philosophy). During my second year I worked as a research assistant in a physics lab at the Nanotechnology center in Bar Ilan University. My years at university have also been years of activism and development of many logistical skills that were in use to arrange protests, conferences, group leading, and cooperation between different organizations. In my mandatory army service I served in the Israeli Navy and developed algorithms as well as data analysis in Elisra (Holon, Israel). Since then I have been working as a research assistant in various fields (gender, bible, philosophy, statistics, and education), and been volunteering with LGBTQ+ young adults. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Ancient Near Eastern studies.</p>
