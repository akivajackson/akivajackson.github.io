Some of these techniques are even more effective if you\u0026rsquo;re giving less away\nA lot of these are outlined more in depth here: How to optimize your taxes as a donor in the US: donate appreciated securities, make a donor-advised fund, and bunch your donations — EA Forum\nGet more money to be given 1. Use an employer match Doubles your money, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t compete with the standard deduction if it directly taken from payroll.\nUsing a friend\u0026rsquo;s employer match Beware the fine print though (source). This is extra good if you give to a friend with a higher tax rate.\nWorse option: Use an external company match (eg Facebook day of giving)1\nGet a better tax deal 2. Have a friend with a higher marginal tax rate give the money Say you want to donate $10,000: Say you make a very nice $70,000 a year. The top $10,000 dollars of your income is taxed at 22%, which means for that portion of income you are only taking home 10,000*(1-0.22)=$7,800.\nBecause charitable donations can be taken as a tax deduction, this means it only costs you $7,800 to donate $10,000.\nBut if you have a rich friend who makes $250,000 a year, they only take home 10,000*(1-0.35)=$6,500 from that top $10k.\nThis means it costs your friend $1,300(!) less to donate $10,000 than it costs you. If you are able to give your friend money, and have them donate it for you, you can donate more for less. It also means that if you want your friend to donate $10k, you only need to give them however much they would take home after taxes ($6.5k minus state taxes) for them to break even.\nThis deal obviously gets better if you have richer friends, or if you\u0026rsquo;re poorer :/.\nN.B.: beware of differences in state income tax. I want to look into doing this across countries, as eg British tax rates are much higher (45% above £125k)\n3. Bunching You can\u0026rsquo;t take the standard deduction if you take an itemized deduction for charitable giving. Say you want to give $10k. The standard deduction for 2024 is $14,600, so you will lose money if you itemize (take the charitable deduction). But if you give triple the amount once every three years, you get a total deduction every three years of $14,600*2 + $30,000 = $59,200 as opposed to $14,600*3 = $43,800.\nEven better if you bunch with someone else! If you and your friend pool your money and one of you donates every 3 years, you get a deduction of ($14,600*5 + $60,000)/2 = $66,500 each.\nDonor Advised Funds A complicated system with some fees that enables you to give a lot of money at once for tax purposes but then disburse it slowly. Useful if you care a lot about giving the money slowly, and maybe make it easier to give stock. See here for more information.\n4. Give stocks You then don\u0026rsquo;t pay capital gains and still get the income tax deduction (Fidelity), which can save you 15% of earnings which can be especially good on old, appreciated stocks. Eg if you give $10k in stock that has been invested in the VTI for the past ten years. The cost basis of that is ~$100 and it is worth ~$270 so you would pay almost $1,000 of capital gains tax if you sold that. So it makes it an extra $1k cheaper to donate that $10k, on top of the income tax savings.\nNotes A more dangerous option: Leveraging stocks can increase your expected donations, but is very complicated and you can lose a lot of money/go into debt if you do it wrong\nBeware, this is only useful if the money otherwise wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gone to the charity of your choice (true counterfactual matching). Lots of matching programs are of money that will be donated either way (see this blog post from GiveWell)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://akivajackson.com/blog/tax-deductions/","tags":null,"title":"Techniques to make your charitable giving go farther"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I live in a house where we run lots of events.

My hygienist and two oral surgeons recommended extraction, but you know what? Did I trust them? Well, sorta.\nMy grandpa was a dentist who specialized in facial pain, and saw lots of patients with damaged nerves, including by wisdom tooth extraction, so he thought you might as well leave them in if you aren\u0026rsquo;t having any problems. And I don\u0026rsquo;t have any problems yet—the surgeons just thought they might come up down the line. So I was wary.\nRCTs My first step was to try to look at the literature. Well, almost 85% of Americans get their wisdom teeth extracted at some point—must mean there\u0026rsquo;s a vast and well-supported literature on it, right?\nWhile symptomatic or diseased impacted wisdom teeth should be recommended for removal, current evidence neither refutes nor confirms the practice of prophylactic removal of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth.1\nHmm, not so premising. Maybe we should try another meta-analysis? I mean that one mentioned something about Swedes, not sure I should trust it. What about this one?\nGhaeminia H, Perry J, Nienhuijs MEL, Toedtling V, Tummers M, Hoppenreijs TJM, Van der Sanden WJM, Mettes TG. Surgical removal versus retention for the management of asymptomatic disease‐free impacted wisdom teeth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2016\nThis will definitely help, right? Here, eight Dutch (so at least not Swedish) researchers searched six major medical databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs—in any language, whether published, ongoing, or unpublished, and found a grand total of\u0026hellip;two.\nNo eligible studies in this review reported the effects of removal compared with retention of asymptomatic disease‐free impacted wisdom teeth on health‐related quality of life.2\nSo we have no RCT evidence, which seems a little rough.\nBut this doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean I\u0026rsquo;m fine. There must be a reason so many people get them out? One scary paper goes through all the terrible things that can happen if you don\u0026rsquo;t get them out, and concludes:\nThere may always be a debate regarding the removal of asymptomatic wisdom teeth but, on scientific review of many related articles, one becomes acutely aware that asymptomatic often does not mean there is no disease present when discussing retained wisdom teeth or third molars.3\nEven if it\u0026rsquo;s not clear whether I should get them out, these researchers seem to promise that I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely have problems if I keep them. What would these problems look like, though? And how likely are they? And what about the problems with getting the extraction, like punching a hole to my sinuses or making my lips permanently numb?\nThe Spreadsheet So I did my usual thing, and spent too much time making a spreadsheet.\nAt the top are all the risks I could find4 of removal, and below are all the risks of keeping the wisdom teeth. The columns contain:\nmy best guess at likelihood from the literature (see below for sources) how long the problem is likely to last and my guesstimate of how much money that discomfort is worth to me (aka how much I would pay to not have it) Seems pretty clear that I should keep them. But then I was looking at prices of dental procedures after I get kicked off my parent\u0026rsquo;s insurance next year, and a conservative 40% likelihood of getting them taken out later,5 multiplied by the cost if my insurance has double the current copay(which seems likely), raises the cost of keeping them by $1800 * 2 * .4 = $1440, which tips the scale in favor of taking them out.\nBut really, my wisdom teeth aren\u0026rsquo;t asymptomatic. They\u0026rsquo;ve been accumulating gunk and sometimes feel a little icky. While I don\u0026rsquo;t have high confidence that I\u0026rsquo;m making the right choice, it seems like there is not much evidence either way, so I\u0026rsquo;ll be letting someone hammer away at my mouth on Thursday.\nWant to try your own numbers?
